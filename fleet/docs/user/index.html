Notes From Revant Nandgaonkar:

<ol>
  <li>I use ACar app on my android phone. So this is my effort trying to move to free open source ACar like app integrated with ERPNext.</li>
  <li>Use Github Issues as well as fork this repo to help me speed up the development!</li>
  <li>Everything currently is on develop branch, I will eventually add some report or dashboard to show atleast mileage of vehicles. That way I can start using this instead of ACar.</li>
</ol>
